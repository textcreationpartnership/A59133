            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>The whole Country is bounded on the North with <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> and other unknown Countryes of the <hi>Indians;</hi> on the West with <hi>Hudsons</hi> River, and <hi>New-York</hi> Colony; on the South and East, with the great Western Ocean, and is now divided into these three great Colonies, <hi>viz. Plymouth, Massachusets,</hi> and <hi>Connecticot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the West Coast of <hi>New-England,</hi> by the Sea-side, are many <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Towns; as first <hi>Westchester,</hi> about 20 Miles from <hi>New York:</hi> To the Eastward of this is <hi>Greenwich,</hi> then <hi>Chichester, Fairfield, Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Milford,</hi> all Sea Towns; Eastward of <hi>Milford,</hi> is <hi>Newhaven, Brainford, Guilford,</hi> and then <hi>Connecticot</hi> River, on which is situated 13 Towns; at the Mouth of the River on the West-side, is the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> and <hi>Brooks</hi> Fort, called <hi>Say-Brooks</hi>-Fort; beyond this North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is the Town of <hi>Middletown, Wethersfield, Hartford;</hi> about it low Land, well stored with Meadows, and very Fertile; then <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi> and <hi>Pinsers</hi> House, all which are situated on the West-side of the River: On the East-side of the River are situated these Towns, <hi>Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Harfield, Dearfield, Springfield,</hi> which Towns are all in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> Colony; the last of which hath been infamous, by reason of Witches therein; <hi>Pistol-Point</hi> is also situated on the East-side of the River, and is in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony; <hi>New-Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> is seated by a small River, called <hi>Pequet</hi> River, which lies to the Eastward of <hi>Connecticot</hi> River.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Connecticot</hi> River to <hi>Hudsons</hi> River, lieth <hi>Long</hi>-Island, stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self 120 miles, but is but narrow, and about 16 miles from the Main; the considerablest Town upon it is <hi>Southampton,</hi> built on the South-side of the Island, toward the East end: Opposite to this on the North-side is <hi>Feversham,</hi> West-ward is <hi>Ashford, Huntington,</hi> &amp;c. The Island is well stored with Sheep and other Cattle, and Corn, and is reasonable Populous. At the East-end lieth three small Islands cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Plumb</hi>-Island, <hi>Shelter</hi>-Island, and <hi>Gardiners</hi>-Island, and due East from the Point of <hi>Long</hi>-Island, lieth <hi>Block</hi>-Island, and near the Main lieth <hi>Fishers</hi> Island.</p>
            <p>The next place of Note on the Main, is <hi>Narragansets</hi> Bay, within which Bay lieth <hi>Rhode</hi> Island, which by the <hi>Bostoners</hi> is uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 line">

            <p>Further Eastward lieth <hi>Monument</hi> Bay, and at the entrance of which, on the East-side, lieth <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Islands, and to the Eastward of them lieth <hi>Martins</hi> Vineyard, and to the Eastward of that lieth <hi>Nantoket</hi> Island. Now we strike off from these Islands to the Main, and arrive at the Wood-land of <hi>Monomoy,</hi> and from thence to Cape <hi>Cod,</hi> (so called at first by Captain <hi>Gosnold,</hi> and his Company, because they took much of that Fish there.) The first place to be taken notice of on the South-side of the Cape, is <hi>West's</hi> Harbour; the first Sea-Town, <hi>Sandwich:</hi> Doubling the Cape, we come now into <hi>Barnstable</hi>-Bay, on the West whereof is <hi>New-Plymouth</hi> Bay, the first <hi>English</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony that took firm Possession in this Country, which was in 1620. and the first Town therein, was built nine years before any other Town; since which time of the first Building thereof, there hath been the increasing of forty Churches in this Colony, but many more in the rest; and the Towns have increased since to the number of 120. for the most part near the Sea-Coasts: The other Towns of Note in this Colony, are <hi>Green</hi> Harbour, to the Eastward of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Point of the Cape, therefore somewhat Inaccessible by Land: here is excellent Timber for Shipping; then <hi>Yarmouth, Rehoboth, Bridgwater, Warwick, Taunton, Eastham,</hi> by the <hi>Indians</hi> called <hi>Namset.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Town Northwest from <hi>Green</hi> Harbour, is <hi>Sittuate,</hi> in the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> Colony; more Northward of <hi>Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate,</hi> is <hi>Conchusset,</hi> and <hi>Hull,</hi> a little Town lying open to the Sea; from thence we come to <hi>Merton</hi> Point, over against which is <hi>Pulling</hi> Point. Upon <hi>Mertin</hi> Point (which is on the Larboard side) is a Town called <hi>Nautascot,</hi> which is two Leagues from <hi>Boston,</hi> where Ships commonly come to an Anchor. <hi>Pulling</hi> Point is so called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Boats are haled against the Tide, which is very strong; it is the usual Channel for Boats to pass into <hi>Massachusets</hi> Bay.</p>
            <p>There is an Island on the South-side of the Passage containing eight Acres of Ground, upon a rising Hill. Within this Island is mounted a Castle, commanding the Entrance; no stately Edifice, nor
<pb facs="tcp:61919:3"/>strong, built with Brick and Stone; kept by a Captain, under whom is a Master-Gunner, and others.</p>
            <p>The Bay is large, made by many Islands; the chief is <hi>Deer</hi>-Island, which is within a flight shot of <hi>Pulling</hi> Point: Great store of Deer were wont to swim thither from the Main; then <hi>Bird</hi> Island, <hi>Glass</hi>-Island, <hi>Slate</hi>-Island, the <hi>Governours Garden,</hi> where the first Apple-Trees in the Country were Planted, and a Vineyard; then <hi>Round</hi>-Island, and <hi>Noddles</hi>-Island not far from <hi>Charles</hi>-Town; most of these Islands lie on the Northside of the Bay.</p>
            <p>The next Town to <hi>Nautascot,</hi> on the South-side of the Bay is <hi>Wissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusset,</hi> a small Village, about three miles from Mount-<hi>Wolleston;</hi> about this Town the Soil is very Fertile,</p>
            <p>Within sight of this is Mount-<hi>Wolleston,</hi> or <hi>Merry</hi>-Mount, called <hi>Massachusets</hi> Fields; where <hi>Chicatabat,</hi> the greatest <hi>Sagamore</hi> of this Country, lived before the Plague. Here the Town of <hi>Braintree</hi> is seated, no Boat nor Ship can come near it, here is an Iron-Mill; to the Westward of this Town is <hi>Naponset</hi> River.</p>
            <p>Six miles beyond <hi>Braintree,</hi> lieth <hi>Dorchester,</hi> a Frontier Town, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly seated, and of large Extent into the main Land, well Watered with two small Rivers; her Body and VVings fill'd somewhat well with Houses, to the number of 200 and more, beautified with rare Orchards and Gardens; having also plenty of Corn-Land, and store of Cattle, counted the greatest Town heretofore in <hi>New-England,</hi> but now gives way to <hi>Boston;</hi> it hath a Harbour to the Northward for Ships.</p>
            <p>A mile from <hi>Dorchester,</hi> is the Town of <hi>Roxbury,</hi> a fair and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Country-Town, the Streets large, the Inhabitants Rich, reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Orchards and Gardens, well watered with Springs and small Freshuts, a Brook runs through it, call'd <hi>Smelt</hi>-River; a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a mile to the North-side of the Town, runs <hi>Stony</hi>-River. It is seated in the bottom of a shallow Bay, but hath no Harbour for Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, only Boats come to it; it hath store of Land and Cattle.</p>

               <head>A Description of the Town of BOSTON.</head>
               <p>IN the bottom of <hi>Massachusets</hi> Bay, is <hi>Boston,</hi> and is the Metropolis of <hi>Massachusets</hi> Colony, or rather of the whole Country, situated upon a Peninsula, about four miles in Compass; almost square, and invironed with the Sea, saving one small Isthmus, which gives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess by Land to other Towns: On the South-side, the Town hath two Hills of equal height, on the Frontier part thereof next the Sea; the one well Fortified on the Superficies with some Artilery mounted commanding any Ship as she Sails into the Harbour, within the still Bay: The other Hill hath a strong Battery built with whole Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and fill'd with Earth. At the descent of the Hill, in the extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part thereof, betweeen these two strong Arms, lies a large Cove or Bay, on which the chiefest part of the Town is built; to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west is a high Mountain, that out-tops all with its three rising Hills on the Summit, called <hi>Tramount;</hi> this is furnished with a Beacon, and great Guns, (as may be seen in the Prospect of the Town, hereunto Annexed:) from hence you may over-look all the Islands in the Bay, and descry such Ships as are upon the Coast. The Houses are, for the most part, raised upon the Sea-Banks, and are Wharfed out with great Industry and Cost, many of them standing upon Piles, close together on each side, as in <hi>London,</hi> and furnished with many fair Shops; their Materials are Brick, Stone, Lime, handsomly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, with three Meeting-Houses, and a Town-House built upon Pillars, where the Merchants may Confer; in the Chambers above, they keep their Monthly Courts. Their Streets are many and large, Paved with Pebble-stone; and the South-side adorned with Gardens and Orchards. The Town is Rich and very Populous, much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by Strangers; here is the Dwelling-House of their Governour.</p>
               <p>On the Northwest and Northeast, two constant Fairs are kept for daily Traffique thereunto: On the South there is a small but pleasant Common, where the Gallants a little before Sun-set walk with their
<pb facs="tcp:61919:4"/>Marmalet Madams, (as they do here in <hi>Moor-fields</hi>) till the Nine-a-Clock Bell rings them Home to their respective Habitations; when presently the Constables walk their Rounds to see good Orders kept, and to take up loose People.</p>
               <p>Two miles from the Town, at a place called <hi>Muddy</hi> River, the Inhabitants have Farms, to which belongs rich Arrable Grounds and Meadows, where they keep their Cattle in the Summer, and bring them to <hi>Boston</hi> in the VVinter. The Harbour before the Town is filled with Ships and other Vessels, for most part of the Year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hingham</hi> is a Town situated upon the Sea-Coasts, Southeast of <hi>Charles</hi> River; there is great store of Timber, Deal-boards, Masts for Ships, white Cedar, and Fish is here to be had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dedham,</hi> an Inland Town, ten miles from <hi>Boston,</hi> in the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> well watered with many pleasant Streams, and abounding with Garden-Fruit; the Inhabitants are Husbandmen, more than a hundred Families, having store of Cattel and Corn.</p>
               <p>The Town of <hi>Waymouth</hi> lies open to the Sea, on the East Rocks and Swamps, to the Southward good store of Deer, Arrable Land and Meadows.</p>
               <p>On the North-side of <hi>Boston,</hi> flows <hi>Charles</hi>-River, which is about six fathom deep; many small Islands lie to the Bay-ward, and Hills on either side of the River, a very good Harbour; here may forty Sail of Ships ride. The Passage from <hi>Boston</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi>-town, is by a Ferry, worth forty or fifty Pound a year, and is a quarter of a mile over: the River <hi>Mistick</hi> runs through the North-side of the town, and by its near approach to <hi>Charles</hi> River, in one place makes a very narrow Neck, where stands most part of the town. The Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place not far from the Water-side, is surrounded with Houses, forth of which issue two Streets, orderly built and beautified with Orchards and Gardens; their Meeting-House stands on the North-side of the Market, having a little hill behind it; there belongs to this town 1200 Acres of good Arrable Land, 400 Head of Cattel, and as many Sheep: these also provide themselves Farms in the Country.</p>
